Having problems uploading the Colab file to Gitub :(

I am getting an error message when I try to upload the ipynb file from my computer.
Closing out my browser and coming bac to Github, the file appears to have been uploaded correctly and I can see my additions.

But when I click "open in Colab" Colab opens the original file from class, it does not have my additons and the name is different.
